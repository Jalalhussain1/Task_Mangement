# Task Ownership and Permissions

## 🔒 Task Ownership System

This application implements a secure task ownership system where users can only modify their own tasks while still being able to view all tasks in a collaborative workspace.

## ✨ Features

### **Task Ownership**
- ✅ **View All Tasks**: All users can see all tasks (collaborative workspace)
- ✅ **Edit Own Tasks**: Users can only edit tasks they created
- ✅ **Delete Own Tasks**: Users can only delete tasks they created
- ✅ **Toggle Own Tasks**: Users can only mark their own tasks as complete/incomplete
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: All users see updates in real-time
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Clear indication of task ownership

### **Security Features**
- ✅ **Backend Validation**: Server-side ownership checks
- ✅ **Frontend Restrictions**: UI only shows actions for own tasks
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for unauthorized actions
- ✅ **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Backend Security (Server-Side)**
```sql
-- Users can only update their own tasks
UPDATE tasks 
SET title = $1, description = $2, category = $3, completed = $4
WHERE id = $5 AND user_id = $6  -- user_id check ensures ownership
```

### **Frontend Security (Client-Side)**
```javascript
// Only show edit/delete buttons for user's own tasks
{task.user_id === user.id && (
  <div className="actions">
    <button onClick={() => onEdit(task)}>Edit</button>
    <button onClick={() => onDelete(task.id)}>Delete</button>
  </div>
)}
```

## 📱 User Interface

### **Task Display**
- **My Tasks**: Blue badge showing "My Task"
- **Other Users' Tasks**: Gray badge showing "[User Name]'s Task"
- **Interactive Elements**: Only shown for own tasks
- **Read-Only View**: Other users' tasks are view-only

### **Visual Indicators**
- 🟦 **Blue Badge**: "My Task" - You can edit/delete
- 🟨 **Gray Badge**: "[Name]'s Task" - Read-only
- ✅ **Interactive Checkbox**: Only for your tasks
- 🔒 **Disabled Actions**: Edit/delete buttons hidden for others' tasks

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Backend API Endpoints**

#### **GET /api/tasks**
- **Access**: All authenticated users
- **Response**: All tasks with user information
- **Purpose**: Collaborative workspace view

#### **POST /api/tasks**
- **Access**: All authenticated users
- **Ownership**: Automatically assigned to current user
- **Purpose**: Create new tasks

#### **PUT /api/tasks/:id**
- **Access**: Task owner only
- **Validation**: `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2`
- **Error**: 404 if not found or not owner
- **Purpose**: Update own tasks

#### **DELETE /api/tasks/:id**
- **Access**: Task owner only
- **Validation**: `WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2`
- **Error**: 404 if not found or not owner
- **Purpose**: Delete own tasks

### **Frontend Components**

#### **TaskList Component**
```javascript
// Only show actions for user's own tasks
{task.user_id === user.id && (
  <div className="actions">
    <EditButton />
    <DeleteButton />
  </div>
)}

// Interactive checkbox only for own tasks
{task.user_id === user.id ? (
  <InteractiveCheckbox />
) : (
  <ReadOnlyCheckbox />
)}
```

#### **Ownership Badges**
```javascript
{task.user_id === user.id ? (
  <span className="badge bg-blue-100 text-blue-700">My Task</span>
) : (
  <span className="badge bg-gray-100 text-gray-600">
    {task.user_name}'s Task
  </span>
)}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Ownership Test Results**
```bash
✅ Shahid cannot update Ahmad's task (404 Not Found)
✅ Ahmad cannot delete Shahid's task (404 Not Found)
✅ Both users can see all tasks
✅ Real-time updates work for all users
✅ Proper error handling for unauthorized actions
```

### **Manual Testing**
1. **Login as Shahid** and create a task
2. **Login as Ahmad** in another window
3. **Verify Ahmad can see** Shahid's task but cannot edit/delete it
4. **Verify Ahmad can create** his own tasks
5. **Verify Shahid cannot edit** Ahmad's tasks
